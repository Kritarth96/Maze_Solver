# Maze_Solver
This repository contains the design, code, and documentation for a bot developed for the Meshmerize competition at IIT Bombay's Techfest. The bot successfully navigates through complex mazes and line-based paths, implementing advanced maze-solving algorithms and efficient line-following techniques.
