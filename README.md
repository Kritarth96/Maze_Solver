# Meshmerize Bot for IIT Bombay Techfest

This repository contains the design, code, and documentation for a bot developed for the **Meshmerize** competition at IIT Bombay's Techfest. The bot successfully navigates complex mazes and line-based paths, implementing advanced maze-solving algorithms and efficient line-following techniques. This project secured **3rd place in the Jaipur zonals** of the competition.

## Features
- **Maze-Solving Algorithm**: Efficiently navigates through varying maze layouts using optimized pathfinding algorithms.
- **Line-Following**: Utilizes a 5-array IR sensor to detect lines and follow paths with precision.
- **Motor Control**: Powered by an Arduino Nano, TB6612FNG motor driver, and N20 motors for smooth and accurate movements.

## Hardware Components
- **Microcontroller**: Arduino Nano
- **Motor Driver**: TB6612FNG
- **Motors**: N20 motors
- **Sensors**: 5-array IR sensor

## Software
- **Programming Language**: C++ for Arduino
- **Algorithm**: Custom maze-solving and line-following logic
