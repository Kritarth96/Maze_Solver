# Maze_Solver
This repository contains the design, code, and documentation for a bot developed for the Meshmerize competition at IIT Bombay's Techfest. The bot successfully navigates through complex mazes and line-based paths, implementing advanced maze-solving algorithms and efficient line-following techniques. 
##Features
Maze-Solving Algorithm: Efficiently navigates through varying maze layouts using optimized pathfinding algorithms.
Line-Following: Utilizes a QTR-8A sensor array to detect lines and follow paths with precision.
Motor Control: Powered by an Arduino Nano and an L298N motor driver for smooth and accurate movements.
##Hardware Components
Microcontroller: Arduino Nano
Sensors: QTR-8A Reflectance Sensor Array
Motor Driver: L298N
##Software
Programming Language: C++ for Arduino
Algorithm: Custom maze-solving and line-following logic
##Getting Started
Clone the repository.
Upload the code to the Arduino Nano.
Assemble the hardware as per the circuit diagram.
Place the bot on a test track and power it on to start the competition simulation.
##Future Enhancements
Add dynamic obstacle detection.
Optimize pathfinding for larger mazes.
